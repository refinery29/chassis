Developing
==========

This project follows the [Git Flow model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) with slashes ('/') separating tokens in branch names.

 * master is for tagged releases
 * develop has all the changes for the next releases
 * feature/____ branches are branched off of develop and merged back into develop
 * release/#.#.# branches are branched off of develop and merged into master
 * hotfix/____ branches are branched off of master and merged into both master and develop
 * experimental/____ branches are branched off of develop. These can ONLY be merged into feature branches.
